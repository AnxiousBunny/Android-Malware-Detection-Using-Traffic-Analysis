# Introduction:
This is The Graduation project for the Students Laith Musallam, Sarah Al-Abbadi and Osama Abu Baker, To complete The requirments needed for bachelor Degree.

**What is the project is about:**
In this project we are trying to Detect Malware application on android devices, by using the traffic generated by malicious applications.

# Information about the application
**How it Works:**
First we Capture the Traffic generated by the application to be tested, then we process the traffic in order to extract features, then we insert it to our detection model in order to be analysed using a pre-defined machine learning model using the Decision Tree algorithm, Then retreive the Results of malicious/benign/not sure.

**How to use:**
Copy the ServerCode directory to a linux or windows machine, run the [main.py](Android-Malware-Detection-Using-Traffic-Analysis/blob/main/serverCode/main.py) script to run the Flask web server, Then use the [nginx.conf](Android-Malware-Detection-Using-Traffic-Analysis/blob/main/serverCode/nginx.conf) to configure the nginx server, and make sure to sign an SSL certificate to get the encryption how to [create a self-signed certificate](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-create-and-use-self-signed-ssl-on-nginx/), make sure to change the ip's in the nginx and the android application python file to corrospond to the right IPS.
After the server is ready, use our android application to test an application, then automatically the application will contact the server to receive the results of the capture.

#Notes:
_-the application need some bug fixing before its Ready for all cases._
_-The server currently accepts small pcaps less than 1 mb, Working on the fix.
